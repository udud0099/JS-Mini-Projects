        ## Before you submit...
        Please keep a few things in mind while writing this issue:

        - Make sure the same challenge (or almost similar challenge) does not already exist.
          - If a similar challenge exists, then consider adding any extra feature to the already-existing challenge instead of creating a new mini-challenge altogether.
        - Use a short and precise title
        - Fill out the text fields with as much detail as possible.
        - If there are relevant screenshots, please do not hesitate to add them.

        **We often get duplicate PRs for challenges that already exist. Please go through the mini-challenges and make sure the one you are contributing does not exist already.**
